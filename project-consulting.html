  <h2>Security Assessments and Gap Analysis</h2>

    Risk assessments and gap analyses to benchmark current-state IT and security readiness against future-state goals.

  <h2>Implementation and Change Management</h2>
  <p>
    Deployments are managed to minimize downtime and disruption, with testing, rollout planning, validation, and handoff.
  </p>

  <h2>Vendor and Contractor Coordination</h2>
  <p>
    I coordinate vendors and contractors directly to enforce accountability on deliverables and timelines.
  </p>

  <h2>Training and Knowledge Transfer</h2>

    Tailored end-user training for enterprise software, operational tools, CRMs, and cybersecurity best practices.
    Projects conclude with documentation and knowledge transfer.
