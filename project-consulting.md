## Project and Consulting Services

I provide project-based IT and AV services for organizations that need focused execution, clear ownership, and results delivered on schedule.

This work is ideal for upgrades, migrations, assessments, and one-time initiatives.

---

## Project Lifecycle Management

I oversee full IT and AV project lifecycles from requirements through closeout.

This includes scope definition, estimation, scheduling, vendor coordination, execution, and delivery validation. Projects are planned to meet technical requirements, timelines, and business expectations with no loose ends.

---

## Network and Infrastructure Projects

I lead infrastructure upgrades and modernization efforts, including:

- Hardware replacement and equipment configuration  
- Structured cabling design and layout planning  
- Network redesigns for scalability and performance  
- Server and infrastructure modernization  

All work follows industry best practices and is designed for long-term stability.

## Security Assessments and Gap Analysis

I conduct detailed risk assessments and gap analyses to benchmark current-state IT and security readiness against future-state objectives.

This includes firewall posture reviews, security control recommendations, and regulatory readiness support. Findings are delivered clearly with actionable next steps.

---

## Implementation and Change Management

Deployments are managed to minimize downtime and disruption.

I coordinate testing, rollout, validation, and handoff to ensure systems work as intended and users can adopt them confidently.

---

## Vendor and Contractor Coordination

I manage contractors and vendors directly to enforce accountability on deliverables and timelines.

Clients have a single point of responsibility while all parties are held to clear expectations.

---

## Training and Knowledge Transfer

I design and deliver tailored end-user training for enterprise software, operational tools, CRMs, and cybersecurity best practices.

Projects conclude with documentation and knowledge transfer so teams are not left dependent on outside help.

---

## Engagement Model

Project and consulting services are offered on a fixed-scope or hourly basis depending on the work.

Scope, risks, and assumptions are defined up front so expectations stay aligned.
