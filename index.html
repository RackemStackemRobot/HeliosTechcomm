  <h1>Helios Techcomm</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Managed IT, Security, and Project Services</p>

  <p>
  Helios Techcomm provides managed IT and consulting services for organizations that need stable systems, secure infrastructure, and accountable execution. Services include ongoing IT support, network and infrastructure management, security and risk oversight, and project delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
  Work is structured around two engagement models, ongoing managed services and focused project or consulting work. Both are designed to reduce operational risk, improve visibility, and deliver outcomes without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.
  </p>

  <p>
  In parallel with client services, Helios Techcomm also supports ongoing research and writing focused on Zero Trust architecture for autonomous and AI-to-AI systems, including the upcoming book <em>11 Controls for Zero Trust Architecture in AI-to-AI Multi-Agent Systems</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Helios Techcomm is also available for speaking engagements, guest lectures, and technical presentations on Managed Services, Customer and Client Training, Project Management, Zero-Trust architecture, multi-agent system security, and practical risk management.
  </p>

  <p>
  We also offer ISO 27001:2022 and SOC2 Audit Preparation.

    <h2>11 Controls for Zero Trust Architecture in AI-to-AI Multi-Agent Systems</h2>

    <p>
      This book explores how Zero Trust principles must evolve for autonomous
      and multi-agent AI systems. It focuses on control layering, trust decay,
      temporal access, and consensus-driven enforcement rather than perimeter-based security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Written for engineers, architects, and security practitioners building
      systems that operate continuously without human intervention.
