    <h2>11 Controls for Zero Trust Architecture in AI-to-AI Multi-Agent Systems</h2>

    <p>
      This book explores how Zero Trust principles must evolve for autonomous
      and multi-agent AI systems. It focuses on control layering, trust decay,
      temporal access, and consensus-driven enforcement rather than perimeter-based security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Written for engineers, architects, and security practitioners building
      systems that operate continuously without human intervention.
