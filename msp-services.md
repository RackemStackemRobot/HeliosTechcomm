## Managed IT Services

I provide managed IT services for organizations that need stable systems, clear accountability, and practical security without hiring a full internal IT team.

The focus is reliability, risk reduction, and visibility. Not ticket churn or vendor upsells.

## Ongoing IT Support

Managed support covers day-to-day stability and issue resolution.

- Endpoint monitoring and alerting  
- Patch management and system updates  
- Remote and on-site troubleshooting  
- User support and incident response  

Problems are addressed proactively where possible and documented when they occur.

## Infrastructure and Network Management

I maintain and improve core IT infrastructure to keep environments scalable and dependable.

- Network monitoring and performance tuning  
- Firewall and router configuration oversight  
- Wi-Fi optimization and segmentation  
- Server and VM management  

Changes are planned and tracked to avoid disruption.

## Security and Risk Oversight

Security is treated as an operational requirement, not a bolt-on product.

- Endpoint protection and hardening  
- Identity and access management guidance  
- Backup verification and recovery readiness  
- Security posture reviews and recommendations  

Risk is explained in plain language so decisions are informed and realistic.

## Documentation and Visibility

Systems are documented so nothing relies on tribal knowledge.

- Environment documentation  
- Configuration baselines  
- Change tracking  
- Risk and dependency visibility  

Clients always know what exists, how it is configured, and where the risks are.

## Engagement Model

Managed services are offered on a monthly retainer based on scope, users, and risk profile.

There are no forced long-term lock-ins. Expectations and boundaries are defined up front.
